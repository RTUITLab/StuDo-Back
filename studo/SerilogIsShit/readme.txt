I couldn't find any info about where Serilog put info about LoggerProviderCollection
I was searching about 3 hours - no results as their readme file says one things - but libraries don't contain what they talk about

Also, I was trying to find this info 1,5 weeks ago - also no results

So, I just copied .cs files from their old libraries to my project to make providers work

Thanks Serilog for documentation (no)
